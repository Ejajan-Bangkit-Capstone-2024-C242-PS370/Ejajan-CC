# Ejajan - Application's Back-end
## Welcome to the Ejajan Cloud Computing Repository
Listed here are the API that were developed for this app
1. Payment API (using Midtrans) - Node.js
2. Menu Recommendation API - Flask
3. Face Recognition API - Flask

### Payment API
We're using Midtrans API to create an endpoint for the payment in our app, deployed on Google Cloud using Cloud Run.

### Menu Recommendation API
Developed with the help of ML cohort in our team, this API is used for giving out menu recommendation based on user's nutritional needs, allergens, and user's last ordered item.

### Face Recognition API
Developed with the help of ML cohort in our team, this API is used to process the face recognition that were used in our app. It uses what's called "Siamese Model Architecture" which accepts 2 images input and compare both images to find similarity.
As of now, there's still an issue with the model and unavailable to use for now.
